        <h3></h3><img src="../image\dog and human.jpg" alt="image" width="400" height="200"> <br>
            The connection between human and dog runs deep. <br>
             Early signs of domestication date back to 33,000 years ago and unambiguously <br>
              domesticated dogs are common in the archaeological record beginning 15,000 years ago. <br>
               The pairing makes for a striking case in coevolution no other species has been so thoroughly integrated into human society. <br> 
               Dogs are our sentinels and shepherds, hunting partners  And more importantly, to those of us who have had dogs in our lives, <br>
                they are our dearest friends. </h3>

    Humans and Horses Have Been Friends for Thousands of Years <br>
    The domestication of wild horses goes back thousands and thousands of years,<br>
    dating to as early as 10,200 B.C. As humans began to tame and learn to ride horses,<br>
    they became more and more domestic, meaning they remained close to humans of their own free will.

Humans have been interacting with dolphins for as long as we have known of their existence. <br> 
Analysis of dolphins has helped us to study and research our origins in the animal kingdom. <br> 
There are several similarities between dolphins and humans that are not even found between humans and apes. <br> 
There are many things to suggest that the dolphin is related to land mammals. <br> 
The fact that they need to get air from the surface of the water is the most obvious sign.
